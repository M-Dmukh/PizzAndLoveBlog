Welcome to my blog. I am a junior web developer, avid gamer, cinephile and enthusiast photographer. This web space will be dedicated to my interests and will be part of a broader work on myself. I hope that you are going to find my content interesting and useful. Feel free to contact me through my social media, which you can find in the footer.
