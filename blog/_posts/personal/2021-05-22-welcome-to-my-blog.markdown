So, here we go, this is my second attempt at keeping a blog. So many things have happened since the last time: I've got a job, I've learned a lot of new things and bought a lot of new expensive toys. I can't wait to write posts about how I have built a PC for the first time or how I've built this blog or how I've started streaming and am learning about videomaking and audio recording in the process. I have also developed a passion for investing (responsibly) and finance in general. I really hope for myself that I am going to keep this project alive. Have a good read. Cheers.
